I want you to help me look into my codebase and provide suggestions for maintainability. Are there areas for improvement, focusing on large files that could be broken down? Is there a better way to organize my files? Should certain files be broken down? Should certain logic be broken down? Does the place the existing code belongs in make sense? Is this future proof in case I want to add functionality, is it easy to add functionality?
